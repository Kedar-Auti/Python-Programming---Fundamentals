# Python-Programming---Fundamentals
for the purpose of learning Basic concepts in Python programming like Object Oriented Programming &amp;
Data structures I created this repository.

In this repository , I'll be uploading python(.py) files as well as Jupyter Notebook(.ipynb) files 
which will consist following fundamental concepts :- 
a)	OOP Concepts in python :
  1)	Encapsulation
  2)	Using Objects
  3)	Static
  4)	Relationships
  5)	Inheritance
  6)	Abstract Class
  7)	Exception Handling 
  8)	 Polymorphism

b)	Data-Structures in python :
  1)	List Data Structure
  2)	Stack
  3)	Queue
  4)	Linked-list 
  5)	Circular Linked-List
  6)	Non-Linear Data Structures
  7)	Hashing and Hash Table

c)	Algorithms :
  1)	Search Algorithms
  2)	Sort Algorithms
  3)	Algorithm Techniques 
  4)	Analysis of algorithms
